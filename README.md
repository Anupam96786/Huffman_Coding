# Huffman_Coding

A C++ encoding and decoding program based on **Huffman Coding**.

## Introduction

This project is designed to **encode** and **decode** strings. **Huffman coding** is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to reduce the number of bit usage. The most frequent character gets the smallest bits code and the least frequent character gets the largest bits code.

## Usage

Download this project and copy the HuffmanCoding.hh file in your working directory.
